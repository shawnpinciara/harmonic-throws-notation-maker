# [Harmonic Throws Notation online maker](https://shawnpinciara.tumblr.com/htnmaker)
## What's HTN?
Online maker for the "harmonic throws notation", a juggling notation invented in France to write routines strictly on time.
The notation tells the exact state of balls, body and relation between body balls, at any given time. It is largely inspired by the standard music notation, which has a really similar way of writing events on time.

## Why?
This tool was created to facilitate the process of writing partitions (process that was done only with paper).
The tool now support saving and uploading a partition (json based).
The whole project is based among P5js, and it was purposely chosen to write the whole website as a SPA and to host it as a custom HTML page on Tumblr.
These restraints give the project the purpose of going beyond structural limits.
